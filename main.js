// Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 

//Creates array from 1--100
const arrayOfNumbers = Array.from({length: 101}, (x, i) => i)
//console.log(arrayOfNumbers)--array is functional

//write for loop to iterate over array



// For multiples of five (5, 10, 15, etc.) print "Chicken" instead of the number | else if
// For the multiples of seven (7, 14, 21, etc.) print "Monkey". | else if
// For numbers which are multiples of both five and seven print "ChickenMonkey". | most specific goes on top-->if statement
// For all other numbers | else
